# TaxCalculator

A C# webforms application that calculates the amount of tax from a given number.

When running the code, this window appears which prompts the user to enter the sales amount and sales tax. There are 3 buttons: the submit button which when clicked, the program will perform the necessary calculations and display them in a pop-up window, the clear button which clears the sales amount textbox when clicked, and the exit button which closes the program.   
  
If a user enters an invalid value in the textbox, an error message will display. This error message will be saved in exceptions.txt. 

The total values will be saved in totals.txt
