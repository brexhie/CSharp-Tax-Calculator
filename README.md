# TaxCalculator

A C# webforms application that calculates the amount of tax from a given number.

# Important: Remember to change the file locations for your txt files.

When running the code, this window appears which prompts the user to enter the sales amount and sales tax. There are 3 buttons: the submit button which when clicked, the program will perform the necessary calculations and display them in a pop-up window, the clear button which clears the sales amount textbox when clicked, and the exit button which closes the program.   
  
If a user enters an invalid value in the textbox, an error message will display. This error message will be saved in exceptions.txt. 

The total values will be saved in totals.txt
